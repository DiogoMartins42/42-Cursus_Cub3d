# Description:
Warning: This project requires the use of the minilibx! Clone it into a [minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) folder.

This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.
